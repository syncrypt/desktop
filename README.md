# Syncrypt Desktop in Elm

This is a WIP version of a rewrite of the Syncrypt Desktop UI in Elm.
Just me trying out Elm for now.

## Compile
    $ elm make src/Main.elm
    # Generates index.html

## Run automatically re-compiling web server
    $ elm reactor
    # -> Go to http://localhost:8000 in your browser
